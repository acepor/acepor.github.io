NER is short for Name Entity Recognition, which is one of fundamental tasks in NLP and critical to other NLP tasks.

As machine learning develops, more and more new methods have been applied in this area. This resource book attempts to give a glance of these methods.

## Vanilla machine learning methods

### CRF

CRF is short for Conditional Random Fields.

__Toolkits__

[CRF++](https://taku910.github.io/crfpp/) is a simple, customizable, and open source implementation of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) for segmenting/labeling sequential data.

[CRFsuite](http://www.chokkan.org/software/crfsuite/): A fast implementation of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs).

[python-crfsuite](https://github.com/scrapinghub/python-crfsuite) is a python binding to CRFsuite.

[sklearn-crfsuite](https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/sklearn-crfsuite) is a thin CRFsuite (python-crfsuite) wrapper which provides interface similar to scikit-learn.

[CRF in Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/crf) Linear-chain CRF layer.

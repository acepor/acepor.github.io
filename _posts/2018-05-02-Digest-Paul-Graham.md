## Default Alive or Default Dead?

Address: [Default Alive or Default Dead?](http://paulgraham.com/aord.html)

In this post, PG explained the most fundamental metric to evaluate the status of a startup by looking at expenses and revenue growth, and surprisingly, half of the founders are not aware of this metric.

Therefore, he suggested:

- Instead of starting to ask too late whether you're default alive or default dead, start asking too early.

And he pointed out the **fatal pitch** of startups:

- The fatal pinch is default dead + slow growth + not enough time to fix it.

And he suggested to avoid the fundraising trap:

- It would be safe to be default dead if you could count on investors saving you.

- So no matter how good your growth is, you can never safely treat fundraising as more than a plan A.

- You should always have a plan B as well: you should know (as in write down) precisely what you'll need to do to survive if you can't raise more money, and precisely when you'll have to switch to plan B if plan A isn't working.

One of the biggest mistakes that startups may have is that:

- Hiring too fast is by far the biggest killer of startups that raise money.

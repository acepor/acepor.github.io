## Learning Numpy Array Chapter 1

### Manipulating array shapes

The appropriately-named function, `flatten()`, does the same as `ravel()`, but `flatten()` always allocates new memory, whereas `ravel()` might return a view of an array.

`a.shape` check the shape of the array a; `a.shape = (m, n)` changes the array a to an (m, n) array.

The `resize()` method works just like the `reshape()` method but modifies the array it operates on.

### Stacking arrays

`hstack((a, b))` is as same as `concatenate((a, b), axis=1)`, as same as `column_stack((a, b))`.

`vstack((a, b))` is as same as `concatenate((a, b), axis=0)`, as same as 'row_stack((a, b))'.

### Splitting arrays

`hsplit(a, 3)` is as same as `split(a, 3, axis=1)`.

`vsplit(a, 3)` is as same as `split(a, 3, axis=0)`.

### Fancy indexing

d = array([21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34])
x = d>30
d[x] = array([31, 32, 33, 34])

### Broadcasting

Because `a = array([1.0,2.0,3.0]), b = 2.0, a * b` moves less memory, (b is a scalar, not an array) around during the multiplication, it is about 10% faster than `a = array([1.0,2.0,3.0]), b = array([2.0,2.0,2.0]), a * b` using the standard numpy.

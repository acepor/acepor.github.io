title: General Pipelines for Chinese NLP Engineering
---

Working in a NLP team, we focused on processing Chinese texual data, and we have been using different tools extensively, namely [Jieba](https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba) and [Stanford NLP software](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/). Either of them has its own advantages and drawbacks. To balance the efficiency and accuracy, we finally chose Stanford NLP software as our default tool in our team. Therefore, this post introduces some major procedures of processing Chinese textual data with the help of Stanford NLP software.

## Cherish Mistakes

In this post, Aaron indicated that mistake are our friends, as 

> Mistakes are our friend. They can be an exasperating friend sometimes, the kind whose antics embarrass and annoy, but their heart is in the right place: they want to help. It’s a bad idea to ignore our friends.

> They’re actually giving us a gift, because they’re pointing the way toward getting better.

When we made mistakes, we need change our attitude to the mistakes, so we would view them from a very different perspective.

> The trick is to confront the mistake, fess up to what went wrong, and think about what you can change to keep it from happening again. Usually just promising not to do it again is not enough: you need to dig into the root causes and address those.

Also, we need dig the root cause of the mistakes in order to fix the problems fundamentaly:

> Only by digging all the way to the root cause did we realize we needed to move the box of belts. The mistake pointed the way to the solution.

And we should be honest to ourselves:

> but even if they’re right that you shouldn’t tell the world about your mistakes, you need to at least tell yourself.

## Fix the machine, not the person

Arron pointed out the problems are not the people, but we always missed this point. This kind of problem is defined as '**fundamental attribution error**'.

> It wasn’t the workers who were the problem; it was the system.

> The mistake is so common that in 1977 Lee Ross decided to name it the “fundamental attribution error”: we attribute people’s behavior to their personality, not their situation.

Yet the problems exist, and we need think out of box to fix the system, not the people:

> True, sometimes you have the wrong gears and need to replace them, but more often you’re just using them in the wrong way. When there’s a problem, you shouldn’t get angry with the gears — you should fix the machine.

> No, you can’t force other people to change. You can, however, change just about everything else. And usually, that’s enough.

Even if the system has only one person -- yourself. Ask help if needed.

> Even if it’s an organization of just you, it’s still helpful to think of it as a kind of machine.

> Life isn’t a high school exam; you don’t have to solve your problems on your own.
